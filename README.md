Our web application aims to empower users in their decision-making process when selecting a suitable HDB flat by providing a comprehensive platform for comparing flat prices. 

Leveraging the extensive data set available from [data.gov](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices), users can access a wealth of information on HDB resale flats. Through our user-friendly interface, users can effortlessly search for flats based on their preferences, such as location, flat type and price. 

Moreover, our included income calculator and loan recommendation allows users to check their eligibility for the flat they wish to purchase, ensuring they find the ideal home that meets their needs and budget.
